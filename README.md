# LTDNet

Traffic text detection plays a crucial role in understanding traffic scenes. Traffic text, being a distinct subset of natural scene text, presents unique challenges beyond those encountered in general natural scene text detection. These challenges include the false alarms arising from non-traffic text sources, such as advertisements displayed alongside roads and signs on building doors. Existing state-of-the-art methods have increasingly complex detection frameworks in pursuit of higher accuracy, leading to challenges in achieving real-time performance. In response to this dilemma, we proposed a real-time and efficient traffic text detector, named as LTDNet,  that strikes a balance between accuracy and real-time capabilities. LTDNet integrates three essential techniques to address these challenges effectively. Firstly, a cascaded multilevel feature fusion network is designed to overcome the limitations of lightweight backbone networks, thereby improving detection accuracy. Secondly, a lightweight feature attention module is developed to enhance inference speed without compromising accuracy. Lastly, a novel point-to-edge distance vector loss function is proposed to enable precise localization of text instance boundaries within traffic contexts. We validate the superiority of our method through extensive experiments on five publicly available datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.
